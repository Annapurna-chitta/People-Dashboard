## Recommendations
* Evaluate Contract-to-Full-Time Conversion Opportunities to Enhance Retention and Workforce Stability
  - A significant portion of employees are in contract roles (33.6%), which may impact long-term retention and organizational stability.
  - Assess the feasibility of converting high-performing contract employees to full-time roles to improve engagement and reduce turnover.

* Address High-Risk Departments with Targeted Interventions
  - The risk score analysis highlights certain departments with higher risk levels, potentially due to performance gaps, workload issues, or attrition trends.
  - Implement customized strategies such as mentorship programs, workload distribution, and targeted support to mitigate these risks.

* Track Performance Before & After Training to Justify Costs
  - Training investments should directly impact employee performance and productivity.
  - Establish key metrics to evaluate pre- and post-training performance to assess effectiveness and optimize future learning programs.

* Conduct Pulse Surveys to Understand Low Engagement/Satisfaction
  - Engagement and satisfaction scores indicate areas of improvement, but deeper insights are required.
  - Implement frequent, short employee surveys to capture real-time feedback and address concerns proactively.

* Foster a Balanced Workforce by Recruiting Across Age Groups
  - The workforce demographic data suggests potential gaps in age diversity, which can impact team dynamics and innovation.
  - Develop hiring strategies that encourage applications from diverse age groups to foster a well-rounded, experienced, and adaptable workforce.
  
* Capture Exit Data Well
  - Understanding why employees leave is crucial for refining retention strategies.
  - Improve exit interview processes and collect structured feedback on reasons for attrition, allowing for data-driven improvements in workforce planning.
